## Job promises data
WRAL's investigation into how incentive programs have performed, including the Job Promise Explorer, analyzed more than 500 incentive grants announced for companies during the administrations of Govs. Bev Perdue and Pat McCrory.

Incentives issued through the state's Job Development Investment Grants and One North Carolina Fund take years to fully pay out as companies ramp up production, build new facilities or relocate, making announcements from 2009 to 2016 an ideal period to evaluate in late 2017.

The analysis is powered by data from the N.C. Department of Commerce and a database manually created by WRAL News using press releases supplied by the state archives.
